    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <section>
      <p>
        I'm Jesse Mota, a programmer and self-taught game developer based in Phoenix, AZ. My journey began
        in high school where I took computer classes and created a simple game, and I've been hooked on game development and
        creative coding ever since.

      <p>
        I am currently a student at Western Governors University, where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I expect to graduate sometime in late 2026 or early 2027. 
        My studies have deepened my understanding of programming concepts and software development practices, and I am eager to apply this knowledge in real-world projects. I am also a self-taught game developer utilizing Unreal Engine 5. 
        I have experience with game design, programming, and project management. I enjoy working on projects that challenge my skills and push me to learn new technologies.

        Outside of coding, I enjoy miniature painting, playing video games, reading and exploring National Parks.
