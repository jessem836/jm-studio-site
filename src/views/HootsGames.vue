        <p>
          An action rogue-like space-shooting game. The Xiual Mind, a pyschic alien race, are preparing to invade the United Earthborn Systems. The player must take flight into Xiual space 
          and destroy the Conduit, a megastructure that unifies the Xiual Mind and amplifies their psychic powers. Along the way, the player will encounter various Xiual ships, each with their own unique abilities and weaknesses. Defeating these 
          ships will grant the player new abilities, allowing them to customize their playstyle and adapt to the challenges ahead.
