          In the distant future, humanity has expanded to the stars, forming the United Earthborn Systems; but the galaxy is vast, leaving the humanity confined to a few systems.
          Until the creation of the Jump-Drive. By harnessing ambiet psionic energy, it violently tears through the fabric of space, allowing for FTL travel and exploration of the galaxy.
          Humanity soon began to colonize new worlds across the galaxy, sending out countless fleets to explore and expand their reach.

          The Xiual are a psychic race of aliens that have uploaded their minds into a megastructure known as the Conduit. They are a hive mind, with each individual being a part of the whole.
          The bodies of the Xiual were turned into crystals during the process, leaving behind their souls within. These crystals were placed into their machines and vessels, allowing them to control them with their minds.
          The Conduit amplified their psionic abilities, permeating the galaxy with psionic energy. But a psychic storm soon ravaged the network, causing the Xiual to face exitinction. The Xiual Mind
          found the source of the storm, humanity's excessive use jump-drives has sent ripples through the fabric of space. Left with no choice, the Xiual Mind declared war on humanity, seeking to preserve their existence.

          A scout fleet of Xiual ships entered a remote system on the edge of the galaxy. A fleet of UES ships were sent to investigate, but they were quickly overwhelmed by the Xiual.
          Though defeated, the UES managed to destroy a few Xiual ships, collecting psionic shards and technologies from their wreckage. The UES reversed engineered the Xiual's technology and
          discovered that the shards contained the soul of a Xiual and a connection to the Conduit, allowing them to harness the pure psionic energy within.
        </p>
        <p>
          Project: Evo began. Sending out experimental ships able to harness the psionic energy from the shards and evolve their capabilities. They had one goal: stop the Xiual invasion.
